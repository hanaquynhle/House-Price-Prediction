# House-Price-Prediction
For this project, I participated in the Kaggle.com competition “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques”. My tasks included preprocessing the dataset, applying various machine learning algorithms to it, tuning my processing and algorithms through many experiments, and documenting my progress and results in a report (Baral_Le_Final_Project_Paper).
